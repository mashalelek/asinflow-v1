# AsinFlow Spec

This document captures the **current rules** of AsinFlow — how the system
behaves today, what each metric means, and the design principles that govern
new work. It is rules-only: no history, no rationale beyond what's needed to
make a rule self-explanatory.

When something here is wrong or stale, fix the doc first, then change the
code. This is the canonical reference both Maria and Claude work from.

Last updated: May 11, 2026.

## 1. Domain Model

AsinFlow is an internal FBA profitability dashboard for a single-seller
operation (Maria, Coastal Quality Goods). It is not multi-tenant SaaS.

### Estimated vs. Actual

Every profit-related metric exists in two forms:

- **Estimated** — forward-looking. "What would I make on a reorder right now?"
  Computed from current market prices (Lowest FBA or Buy Box), expected COGS,
  and current settings.
- **Actual** — backward-looking. "What did I actually make on what I sold?"
  Computed from realized sales data (revenue, units sold, fees, etc.) over a
  date range.

The two are never blended. Filters and views must use one or the other, never
a hybrid metric. (Past hybrids like "current price + actual COGS + estimated
fees" are explicitly forbidden.)

### ⚠️ Critical caveat: Actual P&L is broken

AsinFlow's Actual profit/margin/ROI are seriously inaccurate today. Per a
side-by-side comparison with SellerBoard for ASIN B07P7Y5J8H (Kar's Nuts)
over the same period:

| Metric | SellerBoard | AsinFlow | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sales | $777.05 | $777.05 | ✅ matches |
| Refunds | 8 | 0 | ❌ missing |
| Refund $ | -$121.98 | not captured | ❌ missing |
| **Net profit** | **$77.62** | **$0.86** | ❌ ~90× too low |
| **Margin** | **9.99%** | **0.1%** | ❌ off by ~100× |
| **ROI** | **26.95%** | **0.3%** | ❌ off by ~90× |

The direction of the error is *understating* profit, which suggests costs
are being overstated somewhere — possibly double-counted fees, mismatched
unit counts, or fees from outside the period being subtracted.

Other known gaps in the Actual P&L data path:

- **Refunds** — not ingested from SP-API. Always shows 0.
- **Amazon fees (FBA, referral, other)** — `actual_fba_fees`,
  `actual_referral_fees`, `actual_other_fees` columns exist in `sales_daily`
  but are populated by the fee engine (estimates), not by Amazon's Finances
  API. Their contents are unverified.
- **Inbound shipping** — currently estimated, not actual.
- **Unit count drift** — minor (1–2 unit) discrepancies in some rows.

Until the audit lands: AsinFlow's Actual profit / margin / ROI are NOT
authoritative. Use SellerBoard for real P&L decisions. AsinFlow's Estimated
metrics are still useful for sourcing and replenishment.

This is a critical gap and warrants a dedicated session. See Section 13.

### Date range

Actuals are scoped to a date range selected at the top of each page. Estimates
are point-in-time (current) and ignore the date range.

---

## 2. COGS Rules

### Estimated COGS vs. Actual COGS

AsinFlow tracks two separate COGS values per ASIN. They serve different
purposes and have separate ownership.

**Estimated COGS (`asin_estimates.estimated_cogs`)**
- Forward-looking. Used to compute Estimated Profit / Margin / ROI.
- "What would this ASIN earn at current price assumptions, at this expected
  cost."
- Source labels (`estimated_cogs_source`): `manual`, `csv`, `imported`
  (Chrome extension), `po_sheet`.
- Written by: CSV upload, manual inline edit, Chrome extension import, and
  PO sync (when source is `po_sheet` or NULL — never when source is `manual`).
- Inline-editable in the UI via the CogsEditor popup.

**Actual COGS (`asin_estimates.actual_cogs`)**
- Backward-looking. Used to compute Actual Profit / Margin / ROI from past
  sales.
- "What did the units I sold actually cost."
- Source labels (`cogs_source`): `po_sheet`, `csv`, `manual`.
- Written by: PO sync (current source of truth), CSV upload during first
  ingestion, manual inline edit (interim — will be removed once the PO
  module is the sole source).
- Inline-editable in the UI for now. Will become read-only once the PO module
  is the sole writer, and eventually derived from FIFO across open lots.

### PO sync behavior

When the PO sync job runs for an ASIN that has a matching PO row:

- Always overwrites `actual_cogs` with the latest PO value. Sets
  `cogs_source = 'po_sheet'`.
- For `estimated_cogs`:
  - If `estimated_cogs_source = 'po_sheet'`: overwrite with latest PO value.
  - If `estimated_cogs_source = 'manual'`: leave alone (manual override
    sticks).
  - If `estimated_cogs IS NULL`: set from PO and mark source `'po_sheet'`.

### Manual override

When the user edits Estimated COGS in the CogsEditor popup:

- `estimated_cogs_source` is set to `'manual'`.
- That ASIN's Est. COGS is now frozen against PO sync.
- A small `M` badge appears next to the value in the Product cell.

### Reset to PO

Two paths to revert a manual override back to PO-sourced:

- **Inline** — "Sync from PO" link in the CogsEditor popup. Visible only when
  source is `'manual'` and a PO COGS exists for the ASIN.
- **Bulk** — "Reset Est. COGS to PO" button in the toolbar. Confirmation
  dialog before run. Overwrites all `manual` rows that have PO data; skips
  manual rows without PO data.

### Product cell display

- Show Actual COGS if present, labeled `COGS: $X.XX`.
- Otherwise show Estimated COGS, labeled `Est. COGS: $X.XX`.
- Inline edit pencil opens a popover with both fields editable.

---

## 3. Prep Cost Rules

Prep cost is **operationally-determined**, not ASIN-specific. It depends on
the user's current prep arrangement (self-prep vs prep center). This makes
its rules different from COGS.

### Estimated Prep Cost

Always uses `settings.prep_cost` (the global default). Never reads PO data.

Rationale: a reorder will be prepped under the *current* arrangement, not
whatever was true historically.

### Actual Prep Cost

Reads `prep_override` from the asin_estimates table, which is populated from
the PO sheet (Col AS, "Prep cost").

Three render states:

| `prep_override` | Display | Warning |
|---|---|---|
| `> 0` | `$X.XX` | none |
| `0` (PO row exists, cell empty/zero) | `$0.00` | none |
| `NULL` (no PO row at all) | `$0.00` | amber warning indicator |

The warning tooltip reads: *"No PO prep cost found. This indicates a missing
PO record or unmapped sale. Actual profit/margin/ROI may be overstated."*

### PO sync write rule

When syncing PO data: empty Col AS on a row that exists writes `0`, not
`NULL`. NULL is reserved for "no PO row at all."

This distinction lets the warning fire only on legitimate data integrity
issues, not on intentional zeros.

---

## 4. Replenishment Filter

An ASIN passes the Replenishment view if **all three** conditions are true:

**(A) Estimated profitability passes any tier:**
- Tier 1: `estimated_roi > 25%` AND `estimated_margin > 10%`
- Tier 2: `estimated_roi > 20%` AND `estimated_margin > 12%`
- Tier 3: `estimated_roi > 15%` AND `estimated_margin > 14%`

**(B) Estimated profit per unit ≥ $3.00**

**(C) Sales gate:** `SUM(sales_daily.units_sold) > 0` for the currently
selected date range.

The filter uses `getEstimatedProfit()` — the same function that powers the
Estimated ROI/Margin/Profit table columns. If a user can see why a row
qualifies by looking at the Estimated columns, the filter is doing the right
thing.

### Out of scope for Replenishment

- Hybrid metrics (current price + actual COGS + estimated fees) are forbidden.
- Velocity-based gating (e.g., "selling N units/day") is not used. The simple
  `units_sold > 0` gate is the rule.

---

## 5. Visibility Toggles vs. Filters

These are **separate concepts**.

### Visibility toggles (view scope)

Three toggles in the toolbar control what's in the working set:

1. **Show gated** — default OFF (hides gated ASINs)
2. **Show meltable** — default depends on date:
   - Apr 15 – Sep 15: OFF (meltable items hidden during summer)
   - Otherwise: ON (meltable items visible)
   User can override; manual state is remembered across reloads within the
   same seasonal window.
3. **Show archived** — default OFF (hides archived ASINs)

Toggles do **not** count toward the active filter count. They do not appear
in the Active Filters modal. They define scope, not filtering.

### Filters (column-level criteria)

Filters are user-applied criteria on column values (e.g., ROI > 20%, Brand =
X, Search: "ABC"). These DO count toward the active filter badge and appear
in the Active Filters modal.

### Active Filters modal

Triggered by the "Active filters (N)" button in the toolbar, which is hidden
entirely when no filters are active.

The modal lists each active filter grouped by category. Each filter row has
an × to remove it individually. Footer has "Clear All" and "Close."

### Search and ASIN selection are one logical filter

When a user types text in search but hasn't selected an ASIN, the modal shows
"Search: [text]" — count = 1.

When a user selects one or more ASINs from the search dropdown, the modal
shows "Selected ASINs: N ASIN(s): ..." — count = 1, regardless of whether
search input still has text.

The two are never shown as separate filters. They are different
representations of the same logical "narrow to specific ASIN(s)" intent.

---

## 6. Column Structure

### Six groups (canonical order)

1. **Description** — Product, Category, Brand, Supplier
2. **Stock** — Stock, Available (FBA), Ordered, Reserved, Sent to FBA, Days Left
3. **Actuals** — Actual COGS, Actual Prep Cost, Actual Units Sold, Refunds,
   Refund %, Actual Avg. Sale Price, Actual Revenue, Actual Total Profit,
   Actual Profit/Unit, Actual ROI, Actual Margin
4. **Estimates** — Estimated COGS, Estimated Prep Cost, Estimated Sale Price,
   Estimated Profit/Unit, Estimated ROI, Estimated Margin, Estimated FBA Fee,
   Estimated Referral Fee, Estimated Inbound Ship., Estimated Additional Fees,
   Max COGS
5. **Sellers** — Sellers (FBA), Sellers (combined), Sellers 7d Δ, Sellers 30d Δ,
   FBA 7d Δ, FBA 30d Δ
6. **Additional info** — Tags, Notes, Sourcing, Meltable, Hazmat, Suppressed,
   Date Added

`COLUMN_GROUPS` array in code is the single source of truth. Both Manage
Columns panel order and table render order derive from it.

### Two-row column headers

Estimates and Actuals columns use stacked two-row headers:

- Row 1: qualifier ("Actual" / "Estimated") — smaller, muted text
- Row 2: metric name ("ROI", "COGS", etc.) — primary header text

Description, Stock, Sellers, and Additional info columns use single-line
headers (no qualifier needed).

No top-level "Estimates" / "Actuals" colored band. The qualifier-on-each-column
pattern carries the distinction.

### Fixed order, no reordering

Drag-to-reorder is disabled. Column order is fixed by `COLUMN_GROUPS`. Users
can toggle visibility per column via Manage Columns, but cannot rearrange.

### Frozen columns

The four leftmost columns are sticky during horizontal scroll:

- `#` (sequential row index)
- Checkbox (selection)
- Cart icon
- Product

A 0.5px hairline divider (`--color-border-tertiary`) marks the boundary
between frozen and scrollable areas.

### Sequential row numbers

The `#` column shows position within the current filtered/sorted view (1 to N
where N = total filtered count). Persists across pagination. Updates when
sort/filter change. Non-sortable, non-filterable.

### Default view presets

The three default view presets (Full View, Replenishment, Sourcing) define
initial column visibility, sort, and applied filters. The following columns
are available in the column picker but are NOT included in any preset by
default — the user enables them per-need:

- Date Added
- Category
- Sourcing
- Max COGS
- Est. COGS (when shown as separate from Actual COGS)
- Meltable, Hazmat, Suppressed (icons appear in Product cell regardless)

## 7. Visual Design

### Palette: warm stone

Light mode:
- Page bg: `#F5F4EF`
- Card/tile bg: `#FFFFFF`
- Controls bar: `#E7E5E4`
- Table column header: `#44403C` (dark stone, white text)
- Table row default: `#FFFFFF`
- Table row zebra: `#FAFAFA`
- Top nav: `#292524` (deep stone, white text)
- Top nav active pill: `#44403C`
- Primary text: `#1C1917`
- Secondary text: `#78716C`
- Tertiary text: `#A8A29E`

Dark mode:
- Page bg: `#1C1917`
- Card/tile bg: `#292524`
- Controls bar: `#292524`
- Table column header: `#44403C`
- Table row default: `#292524`
- Table row zebra: `#1F1B18`
- Top nav: `#0C0A09`
- Top nav active pill: `#292524`
- Primary text: `#F5F5F4`
- Secondary text: `#A8A29E`
- Tertiary text: `#78716C`

Top nav and table column header keep dark surfaces in both light and dark
page modes — that's intentional.

### Layering principles

- Hierarchy comes from background color deltas + spacing, NOT from box-borders
  around containers.
- KPI tiles: no border outline. Lifted from page bg via slightly lighter
  surface. Each tile has a 3px colored left-border accent (decorative).
- Filter/controls bar: distinguished from page bg by surface color, not
  borders.
- Table: dark column header bar is the only strong horizontal element. Row
  separation via zebra stripe + 0.5px hairline horizontal borders.

### What NOT to add

- No vertical column dividers (except the single freeze-boundary divider).
- No row-level background tints for profitability (no `bg-emerald-500/8` on
  profitable rows, no `bg-red-500/8` on unprofitable rows). Semantic color
  lives in the cell text only.
- No tinted "Estimates" / "Actuals" group header bands.
- No saturated accent colors for structural elements. Color goes into:
  - Active states (selected nav, primary buttons, focus rings)
  - Semantic text (positive ROI green, negative ROI red)
  - Decorative tile accents (left-borders)
  - Warning indicators (amber)

### Typography & spacing

Small/muted for metadata, larger/primary for values. Minimum form element
borders for hit-target clarity (search, dropdowns) — these are the exception
to the "no container borders" rule.

---

## 8. Top Navigation

Items in order:

- **AsinFlow** (logo, far left)
- **ASINs** — active route
- **Analytics** — active route
- **POs** — disabled, "Soon" badge
- **Gift Cards** — disabled, "Soon" badge
- **Repricer** — disabled, "Soon" badge
- **Shipments** — disabled, "Soon" badge
- (right side) **Dark mode toggle**

Disabled items: muted text, no hover state, not clickable. The "Soon" badge
indicates a planned future module.

When a future module ships, its nav item activates. The structure of the top
nav doesn't change.

A sub-nav strip below the top nav will be added when the PO module ships
(for POs / Suppliers / Invoices / Reconciliation sub-pages). Not built yet.

---

## 9. Settings

Accessed via gear icon in the toolbar (not in top nav). Opens a modal with
global defaults:

- **Prep cost** — per unit, used for Estimated Prep Cost calculation
- **Hazmat surcharge** — per unit, applied to hazmat-flagged ASINs
- **Inbound shipping rate** — $/lb, used for Estimated Inbound Ship.
- **Price source** — Lowest FBA or Buy Box (also exposed as a toolbar toggle)
- **Max COGS thresholds** — three values used by the Max COGS column:
  - `max_cogs_min_margin_pct` (default 12)
  - `max_cogs_min_roi_pct` (default 20)
  - `max_cogs_min_profit_unit` (default 3)
- Other operational defaults

Settings values are read by the calculation engine and apply to all Estimated
metrics across the app.

---

## 10. Naming Conventions

### Prep center shipments

All inbound shipments at the prep center are named:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_supplier-domain_orderID_short-description
```

Example: `2026-04-15_acmesupply.com_PO-1247_widgets-blue`

- Underscore-delimited, exactly four fields
- `supplier-domain` = bare domain, no `https://`, no `www.`
- `order_id` matches the PO sheet's order ID exactly

This convention is the foundation for the future prep center webhook
integration. The composite match key is `supplier_domain + order_id` (order
IDs may collide across suppliers).

### Invoice files

PO invoice files (when stored in the in-app PO module) follow:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_SupplierName_OrderID
```

---

## 11. Integration Points

### Google Sheets PO tracker

- **Sheet ID:** `1WC7r4Z-fIVENFoj_Z14rAgXs2U4Etue0BM065DPGl7Q`
- **Tab name:** `Orders`
- **Range:** `A2:AS` (extends through Col AS for prep cost)

Column mappings used by AsinFlow:

| Column | Index | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| U | 20 | Ordered qty | Excluded if status contains "closed" or "canceled" |
| Y | 24 | COGS | True product cost only (prep removed). First non-canceled row per ASIN |
| AS | 44 | Prep cost | Empty cell on a real PO row → write `0`, not `NULL` |

Status filtering uses `.toLowerCase().includes()` for compound statuses
(e.g., "Closed, Returned" matches "closed").

Note: Col Y was historically prep-inclusive but has been cleaned up — prep is
now in Col AS exclusively. Any `actual_cogs` values in the DB from older PO
syncs are "dirty" until the next sync overwrites them with clean Col Y data.

### SP-API

Currently used endpoints:

- `getInventorySummaries` — inventory snapshot (FBA available, reserved,
  inbound shipped, inbound receiving)
- `GET_FLAT_FILE_ALL_ORDERS_DATA_BY_ORDER_DATE_GENERAL` — sales data (30-day
  max range; chunked sequentially with 2-second delays)
- Listings Restrictions API (`/listings/2021-08-01/restrictions`) — ungating
  status check
- `getCompetitivePricing` / `getItemOffers` — pricing and seller counts
  (`Summary.TotalOfferCount` for total seller count when implemented)

Not yet integrated:

- **Finances API** — would provide actual Amazon fees, refund amounts,
  promo costs. Required for true Actuals (see Section 13).
- **Inventory Adjustments report** — for lost/damaged/found units.
- **Removal Orders report** — for removal-and-reship lineage.
- **Returns report** — for sellable/unsellable disposition.

### External tools (cross-reference for accuracy)

- **SellerAmp** — for sourcing decisions and gating/meltable verification
- **SellerBoard** — currently the trustworthy source for actual P&L. Used to
  cross-check AsinFlow's Actuals.
- **Keepa** — price history (graph URL pattern in code)

### Seller Snap (planned)

When implemented, COGS and MIN prices will be pushed via Seller Snap API.
Inventory age buckets:
- 0–60 days → 15% ROI floor
- 61+ days → 0% ROI floor (liquidation candidates)

Watch List for liquidation candidates surfaces in-app with manual approval
required before pushing MIN price overrides.

---

## 12. Roadmap (Planned, Not Built)

In rough priority order:

1. **PO module** — replaces Google Sheets PO tracker. Two-level hierarchy
   (invoice + line items), per-PO landed cost per unit, gift card discounts,
   tax handling, refund reconciliation. Foundational for several downstream
   features.
2. **Inventory movement journal + FIFO costing** — depends on PO module. See
   Section 15 for the full lifecycle architecture.
3. **FBA inbound shipment reconciliation** — every shipped unit linked to a
   specific PO (or to a removal order, which traces back to a PO). Depends
   on PO module.
4. **Actuals data audit + Finances API integration** — see Section 13. The
   single largest data integrity issue in the system.
5. **Seller Snap COGS + MIN price automation** — depends on PO module
6. **Auth + cloud deploy** — currently local-only
7. **Chrome extension rebuild** — injected content panel architecture
   (replaces the scrapped Side Panel approach)
8. **Prep center webhook integration** — depends on PO module. Parses
   shipment names per the convention above.

---

## 13. Known Data Ingestion Gaps

These are tracked here so we don't lose them. Each represents a column or
metric that exists in the UI but doesn't pull the right data today. To be
addressed in dedicated audit sessions.

### Critical: Actual P&L is broken

Per side-by-side comparison with SellerBoard for ASIN B07P7Y5J8H over the
same period:

| Metric | SellerBoard | AsinFlow |
|---|---|---|
| Sales | $777.05 | $777.05 |
| Refunds | 8 | 0 |
| Refund $ | -$121.98 | not captured |
| Net profit | $77.62 | $0.86 |
| Margin | 9.99% | 0.1% |
| ROI | 26.95% | 0.3% |

AsinFlow's Actual profit is roughly 90× lower than SellerBoard's — costs are
being substantially overstated somewhere in the calculation. The gap is not
"close to right with some missing data." The numbers are wrong by orders of
magnitude.

Specific known gaps:

- **Refunds** — not ingested from SP-API. Always shows 0 in the table, but
  refund effects may be leaking into the cost side of the calculation in an
  unexpected way that warrants diagnosis.
- **Amazon fees (FBA, referral, other)** — `actual_fba_fees`,
  `actual_referral_fees`, `actual_other_fees` columns in `sales_daily` are
  populated by the fee engine, not by Amazon's Finances API. The values are
  unverified.
- **Inbound shipping** — currently estimated, not actual.
- **Unit count drift** — minor (1–2 unit) discrepancies in some rows.
- **Cost double-counting** — suspected based on the magnitude of the
  understatement. Worth specific investigation: are fees being subtracted
  from both revenue AND from a derived field? Are COGS being applied per
  unit but multiplied by total units somewhere downstream?

Required work: full audit of every Actuals field's data path. Trace from
SP-API source → DB write → DB read → table render. Wire Finances API for
fee data. Wire refund ingestion. Verify Actual Avg. Sale Price calculation.
Reconcile against SellerBoard for at least 5–10 representative ASINs across
different volume bands. Plan a dedicated session with diagnosis before
patching.

Until this lands: AsinFlow's Actual profit / margin / ROI are NOT
authoritative. Use SellerBoard for real P&L decisions.

### Inventory adjustment data not synced

SP-API Inventory Adjustments report, Removal Order Details report, and
Returns Report are not yet ingested. Once synced, they feed the inventory
movement journal (see Section 15). Until then, lost/damaged/returned units
do not flow into AsinFlow's inventory state.

### Other gaps

- **Combined Sellers / Sellers 7d Δ / Sellers 30d Δ** — `sellersFbm` field
  is never populated. Need SP-API ingestion for `Summary.TotalOfferCount`,
  schema migration for `sellers_total`, history snapshots for deltas.
- **Meltable flag** — ASINs flagged as meltable in SellerAmp/Amazon don't
  show as meltable in AsinFlow. Diagnose: is the field captured from SP-API?
  Is the column rendering? Is the seasonal hide logic interfering?

---

## 14. Architectural Principles

A few things that aren't strictly rules but inform how decisions get made.

### Source of truth

Every piece of data has exactly one canonical source. Most current examples:

- Column structure → `COLUMN_GROUPS` in shared/schema.ts
- COGS and prep cost → DB fields populated by sync jobs
- Calculations → centralized functions (`getEstimatedProfit`,
  `getEffectivePrep`) that the entire UI reads from

When something has two sources (e.g., search input + ASIN selection both
representing one logical filter), they get consolidated. Two state
representations of the same thing is a bug, not a feature.

### Source-of-truth ownership per field

Each field on `asins` and `asin_estimates` has exactly one owning workflow
that writes it:

| Field | Owner |
|---|---|
| Pricing, fees, BSR, sellers | Analyze path |
| Catalog data (title, brand, category, dimensions, weight, etc.) | Analyze path |
| `estimated_cogs` | CSV upload / manual edit / Chrome extension / PO sync (when source ≠ manual) |
| `actual_cogs` | PO sync (eventually FIFO calc) / manual edit (interim) |
| `prep_override` | PO sync |
| `buy_link`, `supplier` | CSV upload / manual edit / Chrome extension |
| Tags, notes | Manual / CSV upload / Chrome extension |
| `is_wholesale`, `is_oa` | Manual edit |
| `is_active` (archive) | Manual edit |

When a code path needs to touch a field outside its ownership, that's a red
flag. Either the architecture is wrong, or the workflow is misnamed.

### Analyze path constraints

The analyze code path (`/api/analyze`, `/api/analyze/all`, single-ASIN
refresh) refreshes Amazon-side data ONLY.

**Analyze MAY write to:**
- `asins`: title, brand, category, dimensions, weight, size_tier, in_catalog,
  is_meltable, is_hazmat, is_gated, gating_reason, is_listing_active
- `asin_estimates`: sale_price, price_source, fba_fee, referral_fee,
  variable_closing_fee, bsr, sellers_fba, sellers_fbm, fetched_at
- Computed estimate fields (`est_profit_unit`, `est_margin`, `est_roi`) when
  recomputed from the above + existing cost data

**Analyze MUST NOT write to (user-controlled fields):**
- `estimated_cogs`, `estimated_cogs_source`
- `actual_cogs`, `cogs_source`
- `prep_override`
- `buy_link`, `supplier`
- Tags, notes
- `is_wholesale`, `is_oa`
- `is_active`

Violations of this rule have caused recurring "COGS clears on analyze" bugs.
When in doubt, the analyze path should leave the field alone.

### Asymmetric UPSERT pattern (interim)

Currently, CSV upload piggybacks on the analyze UPSERT to persist
`estimated_cogs` on first ASIN insertion. To avoid clobbering existing values
on re-analyze of known ASINs, the UPSERT is asymmetric:

- **INSERT branch (new ASIN):** includes `estimated_cogs` (from CSV input)
  and `estimated_cogs_source = 'csv'`.
- **ON CONFLICT UPDATE branch (existing ASIN):** does NOT touch
  `estimated_cogs` or `estimated_cogs_source`. Only refreshes
  pricing/fees/catalog fields.

This is an architectural smell. Long-term, CSV upload should have its own
dedicated write path for user-controlled fields, independent of analyze. Fix
when convenient — likely during the Scan section build.

### Single recalculation point

Profitability is recalculated server-side using current settings. The Chrome
extension sends a minimal payload (`{ asin, cogs?, buy_link?, tags?, notes? }`)
and AsinFlow recomputes. This keeps logic centralized and avoids drift.

### Tiered referral fees (Clothing, Jewelry, Watches, etc.)

Tiered-category referral fees are computed locally from
`shared/fee-engine/feeData.json` at the display price via
`computeReferralFee()` in `shared/schema.ts` — **not** scaled linearly from
SP-API's estimate-price referral fee. Linear scaling is wrong whenever the
display price crosses a tier boundary (e.g. Clothing apparel: 5% ≤$15, 10%
$15.01–$20, 17% >$20 — a sock estimated at $19.94/10% but sold at $25 must be
17%, not a linearly-scaled 10%).

Two tier semantics exist and are distinguished by `tierMode` in feeData.json:
- **bracket** (Clothing, Baby, Beauty/Health, Grocery): one rate, chosen by
  which band the whole price lands in.
- **marginal** (Jewelry, Watches, Furniture, Fine Art, …): per-portion rates
  summed across bands. Default when `tierMode` is absent.

The SP-API browse category (`asins.category`) is a coarse umbrella — e.g.
"Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" covers tiered apparel **and** flat-15% shoes,
handbags and plush. So the local recompute is only applied when SP-API's own
referral fee at the estimate price matches what the tier table predicts
there; on mismatch (or unmapped/flat category) it falls back to linear
scaling of SP-API's accurate per-ASIN value and logs a `[referral]` warning.

### Forward-looking vs backward-looking

Everything in the system has one of two time orientations:

- **Forward-looking** (Estimated): uses current settings, current market
  prices, current expected COGS. Reflects "what would I do now?"
- **Backward-looking** (Actual): uses historical data within a date range.
  Reflects "what did I do?"

When in doubt about which source a metric should use, ask which question the
user is trying to answer.

### Honest labeling

If a metric is named "Actual" but computed from Estimates, that's a bug — fix
the data path or rename the metric. Do not accept misleading labels in the
UI.

(The current state of AsinFlow's Actuals violates this principle. Section 13
captures the gap; it must be addressed.)

### Push back on stale spec

If the user is heading in a wrong direction or asking for something that
contradicts an established rule, raise it. Pretend-agreement is worse than
honest pushback. Maria has explicitly asked for this.

## 15. Inventory Lifecycle & Lot Tracking (Planned)

This section captures the planned architecture for inventory tracking once
the PO module ships. Not yet implemented.

### Principles

1. **Aggregate FIFO at the ASIN level.** No per-unit tracking. Cost basis is
   maintained as a FIFO queue of lots; sales draw from the front, deposits
   add to the back.
2. **POs define lots.** Each `po_line_items` row is conceptually a lot with
   `landed_cost_per_unit` (product + prep + tax + allocated shipping −
   allocated discounts). Tax and order-level discounts already live in
   Col Y of the PO sheet; only prep (Col AS) and inbound shipping need to
   be added at the lot level.
3. **Inventory state is derived, not stored.** State is computed by walking
   an `inventory_movements` event journal in chronological order.
4. **Every FBA inbound shipment ties to a PO.** Either directly (fresh PO →
   FBA) or indirectly (PO → FBA → removal → re-ship). No orphan shipments.
5. **Removal orders maintain PO linkage.** When units are removed from FBA,
   the removal order ties back to the PO whose units were consumed (FIFO).
6. **Re-shipments link removal order → PO chain.** When previously-removed
   units re-enter FBA via a new inbound shipment, the shipment ties to the
   removal order, which ties back to the original PO.

### Event types in `inventory_movements`

- `inbound` — units arrive at FBA from a fresh PO
- `reship` — units arrive at FBA as a re-ship of a prior removal
- `sale` — units consumed via customer order
- `removal` — units leave FBA via removal order (not yet a write-off)
- `loss` — units leave FBA via Amazon-side loss/damage (permanent inventory
  exit until/unless a `found` event reverses it)
- `found` — Amazon locates previously-lost units and returns them to
  inventory
- `disposed` — units disposed of (write-off)

Each event has: `asin_id`, `event_type`, `event_date`, `qty` (signed),
`unit_cost` (snapshot at inbound/reship), `source_id` (FK to PO line item or
prior event), `notes`.

### FIFO costing

When a sale event occurs, units are consumed from the front of the FIFO
queue. The cost basis at the time of consumption is recorded against that
sale. The same algorithm applies to removals and losses (units leave the
queue, but only sales produce COGS).

### Reshipment reconciliation

When a new FBA inbound shipment lands without a matching open PO, AsinFlow
proposes matches from open removal orders for the same ASIN, ranked by qty
match and recency. User confirms the linkage. Fallback: manual link to a PO
directly.

### Inventory Cost calculation

Total inventory cost = sum over all non-terminal events of
`(remaining_qty × unit_cost)` from the FIFO queue. Includes units in FBA,
units in re-ship limbo (removed but not yet disposed or re-shipped), and
units in open POs not yet shipped. Excludes terminal states (sold, lost,
disposed).

### PO section UI: lifecycle breakdown

Each PO displays a status breakdown showing the current state of its units:

```
Sold:                  N units
Currently in FBA:      N units
Awaiting re-ship:      N units (from removal #XXXX)
Lost (Amazon):         N units
Disposed:              N units
Total:                 N units ✓
```

The PO itself stays at "fully shipped" once all units have been sent to FBA
at least once. Re-ship limbo is an operational state on top, not a
modification to the PO's shipping count.

## 16. Sourcing Flags (Wholesale / OA)

Two independent boolean fields on the `asins` table track sourcing type:

- `is_wholesale BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE`
- `is_oa BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE`

An ASIN may be:
- Wholesale only (`is_wholesale = true, is_oa = false`)
- OA only (`is_oa = true, is_wholesale = false`)
- Both (`is_wholesale = true, is_oa = true`) — e.g., originally OA, now also
  wholesale
- Neither (`is_wholesale = false, is_oa = false`) — legacy/unset only

### Source

User-set only. No auto-detection from supplier domain or other heuristics.

### UI

- **Column:** "Sourcing" — displays "W", "OA", "W + OA", or dash. Inline
  editable via popover with two checkboxes.
- **Filter:** Multi-select dropdown — Wholesale / OA / Both / None, with
  counts. Same pattern as Tags and Supplier filters.
- Not in any view preset by default.

### Legacy "Wholesale" tag

The legacy "Wholesale" tag in the `tags` table is preserved. The boolean
flag and the tag are not synced — they coexist independently.

## 17. CSV Upload — Duplicate ASIN Handling (Planned)

When a user uploads a CSV/XLSX containing ASINs that already exist in the
catalog, AsinFlow surfaces them before processing.

### Pre-upload check

Identify which ASINs in the upload already exist in the `asins` table.

### Duplicate dialog

If any duplicates found, show a modal with three options:

- **Skip duplicates** (default): process only new ASINs; existing rows
  untouched.
- **Overwrite duplicates:** for duplicates, update `buy_link`, `supplier`,
  `estimated_cogs`, `notes`, and tag associations to match the upload. Do
  not touch fields not present in the upload — never clear `actual_cogs`,
  analyze-refreshed fields, or other user-controlled state that wasn't part
  of the upload.
- **Cancel upload:** abort entirely.

The "all duplicates" case still surfaces the dialog with the same options.

## Maintenance

- Update this doc before changing the rule it describes. The doc is the spec;
  code follows.
- When a memory/conversation gap surfaces, the recovery is "is this in
  SPEC.md?" — not "did Claude remember?"
- Periodic refresh: review the whole doc every few weeks or when a major
  feature ships. Stale rules are worse than missing ones.
